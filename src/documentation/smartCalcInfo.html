<h2 id="about-project">About project</h2>
<p>In this project, a scientific calculator is implemented that can perform calculations with arbitrary bracket
    expressions, as well as calculate the expression with substitution of a number together with &quot;x&quot;.
    In addition, the construction of graphs of arbitrary mathematical expressions is implemented.
    The bonus is made by a loan calculator that allows you to calculate a loan in two formats in annuity,
    differentiated.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-details">Implementation details</h2>
<p>All calculators have a graphical interface, the code is also written using the C ++ language and built according to
    the MVC principle (model, view, controller). All expressions are validated and processed in the model. The project
    is unit tested and has full coverage.</p>

<p>Calculator Features
    Bracketed arithmetic expressions in infix notation must support the following arithmetic
    operations(+,-,/,*,mod,^,unary - and unary +) and mathematical functions</p>

<h2 id="graph">Graph</h2>
<p>With this application, you can draw graphs with a range of definitions from -1,000,000 to 1,000,000 and a range of
    values ​​from -1,000,000 to 1,000,000.</p>

<p>The loan calculator allows you to calculate a loan for different types of monthly payments: annuity and
    differentiated.</p>
<p><strong>Annuity</strong> - represents equal monthly amounts throughout the entire term of the loan.</p>
<p><strong>Differentiated</strong> - the amount of the monthly payment decreases by the end of the loan term.</p>
<p>The interface of the calculator is intuitive and even an inexperienced user will be able to correctly calculate his
    monthly payment and the final overpayment, thereby choosing the best option for himself.</p>
<h2 id="project-build-instructions">Project build instructions</h2>
<p>On the PC should be qt 6 version. Assembly is done using cmake.
    The project implemented a Makefile with targets (all, install, uninstall, clean, dvi, dist, tests)
    To install the application, the command in the src directory is &quot;make install&quot;</p>
